# LilypondFileGenerator
The main LilypadFileGeneratorLambda class processes a file from S3, generates the LilyPond notation, and stores it back in S3.

Let's focus on adapting the LilypadFileGenerator to work as an AWS Lambda function. The solution will involve converting your current logic to work within the Lambda environment, leveraging S3 to handle input/output, and ensuring we handle large files and process them in chunks. Below are the full files for the Lambda function.

File 1: LilypadFileGeneratorLambda.java
This file will be your Lambda handler. It will be responsible for:
- Fetching the audio/text data from S3.
- Processing the data (just like your original logic).
- Uploading the results back to S3.


 File 2: pom.xml file 
 This file will manage dependencies for the Lambda function.

 # Todo
Logging in handleRequest: Logs when the Lambda receives the event and when files are fetched and processed from S3.
Logging in processFile: Logs the starting of file processing and any notable actions like processing a sample, detecting a peak, or writing output.
Logging in handleDequeProcessing: Logs details about deque operations, like when a new sample is processed or a peak is found.
Logging in processPeakSample: Logs when a peak is detected, the number of notes extracted, and the results written into the .ly file.
